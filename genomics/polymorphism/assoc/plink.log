Reading map (extended format) from [ mudym.bim ] 
8000 markers to be included from [ mudym.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ mudym.fam ] 
1000 individuals read from [ mudym.fam ] 
989 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
328 cases, 661 controls and 11 missing
500 males, 500 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ mudym.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 8000 SNPs
1000 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.989962
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 8000 SNPs
After filtering, 328 cases, 661 controls and 11 missing
After filtering, 500 males, 500 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
